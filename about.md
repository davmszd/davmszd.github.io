Hi! I'm Davood Moosazadeh and I'm a full stack web developer. I'm currently working on [Microsoft stack](https://medium.com/@SirwanAfifi/why-i-love-hate-microsoft-stack-6d8a097afc64), Recently I fell in love with JavaScript.

### More Information

I [code](https://github.com/SirwanAfifi), blog and [tweet](https://twitter.com/SirwanAfifi). Besides writing software, I try to help others by posting on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1646540/sirwan-afifi), also I learn new things by asking questions I ran into there.

### Why have you built this blog?
In fact I have to say I've been entertaining the idea of building a blog about stuff I learn everyday for quite a long time now, becuase keeping track of new things I learn was a big deal for me, So I came up with this idea that a blog can help me to solve this problem

### Hobbies
When I'm not programming you can find me on reading a book, watching a movie/series or listening to some music.

### Contact me
If you want say hi, feel free to drop me an email or hit me up on Twitter @SirwanAfifi. I look forward to hearing from you!
